These are my submissions for CodeSprint Quora (Mar 3, 2012).

I didn't solve any problems completely, scored a total of 30 points and was
ranked 114th out of 210+ participants.

This was just about the toughest sprint ever. Looks like Quora folks were
looking for ready-made ML experts, not sure whether they've found any. :-)

It looked like it from the start, too, so I wasn't at all sure I wanted to
participate, but

QUORA FEED OPTIMIZER

This looked obviously related to knapsack problem, and I was just recently
reading about that. I decided to implement a straightforward DP algo (even
though it was obvious the moving window would neutralize much of its
efficacy), and see where it takes me.

Initial proto in PHP was pretty memory-hungry, even though it seemed otherwise
correct, so I reimplemented it in C++. As expected, this didn't get me too
far, as whenever an item would drop off the bottom of the window, I would have
to recalculate the whole solution tree.

I mulled over this for about an hour, but after that real-life commitments
pulled me away from the contest.

Given the significant difficulty of the problems, the contest deadline was
extended a whole day, and after that the organizers rolled out a week-long
"Quora Marathon", but I didn't participate in either event.
