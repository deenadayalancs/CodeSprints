These are my submissions for CodeSprint OxygenCloud (July 7, 2012).

I didn't solve any problems this time, scored just 8 points and was ranked
53th out of 64 participants.

This one had rather tough problems, and as is usually the case with such
contests my performance was very poor.

ONE PERSON GAME

This looked suspiciously NP to me, so I gave up on it after thinking about it
for just a few minutes. I'm not sure what the expected solution was, and
unless I'm much mistaken, no one's found it during the contest (although some
folks seem to have submitted correct solutions after the deadline).

DATA CENTER

This one looked more approachable, despite the fact that I'm not really into
combinatorics. In any case, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to
correctly calculate the result, but in the end it was all in vain. I did reach
a correct solution (recursive, expressed through binomial coefficients and
modular exponentiation), but that was way too slow to make a good dent in the
test cases. Having made so little progress and with just half an hour
remaining I decided against trying to figure out a better solution.

I'm not really sure what would be a good plan for solving this, but some sort
of a closed formula must be in order, otherwise it would be hard to approach
the performance needed to hack through the final test cases.

The contest was extended by a full hour in the end, but I was unaware of that,
having quit before the announcement.
