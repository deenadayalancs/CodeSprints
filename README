My submissions for various CodeSprints held by interviewstreet.com.

Individual contest directories contain detailed READMEs.

IMPORTANT: I most emphatically do not approve of many coding practices and
style quirks exhibited therein. Coding contests imply severe time pressure,
which leads, at least in my case, to favouring in-time, on-spec, ugly as hell
approach to implementation.

Under more normal circumstances I always try to remember that code is written
for other people's consumption first and foremost.
