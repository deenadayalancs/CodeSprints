These are my submissions for CodeSprint Extreme Startups/Canada (Apr 28,
2012).

I solved just one problem out of four, scored 115 points, and was ranked
74th out of 280+ contestants.

A rather poor performance this time. I made a bunch of strategic errors, and
frankly, felt straight out dumb throughout the contest. I blame six-day
working week before the holidays, but it was a sucky showing anyway.

(my remarks on problems to be posted later)
